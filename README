This tool adds zero-value return values to incomplete Go return
statements, to save you time when writing Go. It is inspired by
and based on goimports.

For example, the following incomplete return statement:

	func F() (int, error) { return errors.New("foo") }

is made complete by adding 0 (the zero value for int):

	func F() (int, error) { return 0, errors.New("foo") }

To install:

	go get sourcegraph.com/sqs/goreturns

To run:

	goreturns file.go

To view a diff showing what it'd do on a sample file:

	goreturns -d $GOPATH/sourcegraph.com/sqs/goreturns/_sample/a.go

Editor integration is not ready yet, but contributions are welcome.

It acts the same as gofmt (same flags, etc) but in addition to code
formatting, also fixes returns.
